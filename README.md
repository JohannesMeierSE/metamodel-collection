# metamodel-collection
A broad collection of metamodels, which will be extended in the future.

## Metamodels expressed in EMF/Ecore

Java (with full support for Java 8)

* metamodel and generated code: https://github.com/JohannesMeierSE/JavaASG
* some generated visualizations: https://github.com/JohannesMeierSE/JavaASG-visualization

PlantUML class diagrams

* metamodel and generated code including two visualizations: https://github.com/JohannesMeierSE/plantuml-modeling

Photos in the file system (for special application)

* metamodel, code, and one visualization: https://github.com/JohannesMeierSE/pictureGallery

Metamodel to describe Abstract Syntaxt/Semantic Graphs (ASGs) for programming languages

Metamodel of Ecore itself

* After `git clone https://git.eclipse.org/r/emf/org.eclipse.emf`, you will find the `Ecore.ecore` in the folder `sources/org.eclipse.emf/plugins/org.eclipse.emf.ecore/model` (together with some old ecore visualizations)
* Some other visualizations of the Ecore metamodel can be found here:
